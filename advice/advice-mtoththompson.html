            <h2 style="color:#008080;">Persevere, repeat and study!</h2>
            <p>I didn't begin my coding journey will Skillcrush. I actually started with Skillcrush to learn about the tools I needed to become a Web Developer and Designer without the degree. I began coding long before I ever realized what coding was. My dad was teaching me how to use the command prompt at the age of 7. I remember using Microsoft Word and his server with an ftp client to upload my first several websites. They were silly and usually complete nonsense. Or made up of those goofy clipart pieces Microsoft used to have.</p>
            <p>I actually began coding as a teenager in highschool. Again, it was for silly project usually related to games. This is also when I started to learn how to design objects in 2D and 3D. It was cool stuff, but I didn't really realize the importance of where it could take me. It was just fun. I never thought of it as a career. In fact, when I graduated high school I immediately went to culinary school.</p>
            <p>So, where is the advice in this? Well, look. I didn't start out trying to learn code. I started out learning it because it was fun and changed the environment I played in. I finally learned to put the effort into coding when I was tired of working in the restaurant industry. I had found out that web designers and developers make a decent income, even when they freelance. I wanted to be a part of that.</p>
            <p>Once I realized there was a real opportunity here, I set out to learn HTML. Then I learned I needed CSS. Then PHP and MySQL. I searched the internet and learned everything I could from YouTube and free online classes. I put together more professional projects and then I actually took on professional projects. Most of those websites are an embarrassment, but they were a start. It took perserverance and a lot of failing to finally figure out how to put a site all the way together. I learned WordPress and how to hand code a site from scratch. The main thing was to never give up, even when it broke - which happened a lot in the beginning.</p>
            <p>My biggest piece of advice - never ever EVER rely on one resource to teach you anything. To code, to cook, to drive - whatever the subject, learn as much as you can from as many places as you can. Practice in as many different ways as you can. No one can learn everything at once, but coding is definitely something you can't learn without a lot of practice.</p>
